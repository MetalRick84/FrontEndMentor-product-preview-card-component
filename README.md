### What I learned

- The difference between **git fetch** and **git pull**
- The Strange <img> Gap In HTML - [stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5804256/image-inside-div-has-extra-space-below-the-image)
- How to create custom VSCode Snippets - [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGh2NpCIDlc&t=135s)
- The Samsung mobile browser does not have a small **viewport height**. Respectively does not see the small toolbar at the bottom as a UI-element.
But if an element is placed absolute at the bottom (bottom: 0) it will appear over the toolbar. I think that also applies to the iPhone browser.
